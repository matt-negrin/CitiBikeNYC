Welcome to my Citibike analysis.

To run the Shiny application 'Citibike,' you will first nead to run the loading and cleaning scripts inside of the scripts folder.

The scripts should be run in the following order:
(1) load.R
(2) clean1.R
(3) clean2.R
(4) clean3.R

Before running load.R, open load.R and alter the working directory (setwd) in the first line so that it makes sense for your machine. I also recommend manually create a Citibike folder in your chosen working directory, with 'data' and 'images' subfolders. With these changes, you should be ready to go.
